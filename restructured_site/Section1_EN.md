## Our Story
Hadash (the Democratic Front for Peace and Equality) was established in 1977. Our aim is to unite all supporters of peace, equality, democracy, and workers’ rights—Jews and Arabs—to create a political alternative to occupation and exploitation.

### Against the Tide:
- **Two States for Two Peoples**: The first to run under this slogan.
- **Socialist Voice**: Fighting for workers in a capitalist state.
- **Jewish-Arab Partnership**: A haven of cooperation in a reality of discrimination.
- **Environmental Justice**: Leading the charge for "The Polluter Pays" and clean air laws.
- **Demilitarization**: The only movement demanding a WMD-free Middle East.

## Key Achievements
- **Labor Protection**: Shielding union organizers and contractor workers from dismissal.
- **Public Housing**: Protection of tenant rights in public housing.
- **Gender Equality**: Abolishing discrimination in unemployment compensation and promoting rights in women's shelters.
- **Education**: Fighting for thousands of missing classrooms in the Arab educational system.

## Join the Struggle
To join Hadash means joining a thrilling trip against "the system." We operate without wealthy donors, relying on a dedicated base of volunteers.
