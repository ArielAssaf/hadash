# Our Vision for equality and peace

Hadash stands for a society where Jewish and Arab citizens coexist in full equality. Our vision includes:

- **Ending the occupation** and establishing a Palestinian state alongside Israel.
- **Social justice** through public services and fair labor laws.
- **Collective rights** for the Arab national minority in Israel.
- **Environmental protection** for future generations.
