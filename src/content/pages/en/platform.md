      A. Ending the occupation of all territories occupied since 1967 and onwards (Palestinian, Syrian, and Lebanese territories) and achieving a permanent solution to the Palestinian issue. This is in order to reach a state of peace and stability in the country and the region, based on respect for the rights of peoples.

      The solution to the Palestinian issue is based on:
      - Complete withdrawal from all territories occupied in 1967.
      - Evacuation of all settlements in the West Bank, including occupied East Jerusalem.
      - Establishment of a fully sovereign Palestinian state with East Jerusalem as its capital, alongside the State of Israel with West Jerusalem as its capital.
      - A solution to the issue of Palestinian refugees from their homeland based on the right of return and/or compensation, in accordance with UN resolutions.

      To advance towards a solution to the Palestinian issue, Hadash struggles against the occupation:
      - To stop all settlement activity in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, including the robbery and looting of private Palestinian lands, including those that the occupation authorities term "state lands." Ending the crimes of Palestinian home demolitions and removing all measures and restrictions designed to prevent Palestinians from building their homes on their lands.
      - To stop all settlement and oppressive practices in occupied East Jerusalem, including attacks on holy sites, and restrictions on the lives of Palestinians in the city of Jerusalem.
      - Ending the siege imposed on the Gaza Strip, ensuring direct connection between Gaza and the West Bank, and opening Gaza's borders to the world.
      - Removing checkpoints in the West Bank and ensuring freedom of movement for Palestinians in the West Bank, including access to their jobs and agricultural lands.
      - To stop all settler attacks carried out under the auspices and protection of the Israeli army against Palestinians and their property in the West Bank, including occupied East Jerusalem.
      - Release of political prisoners, ending the use of administrative detention, and ending all forms of physical and psychological torture. Likewise, ending collective punishments imposed against Palestinians.

      1. Hadash fights against the official economic policy that completely contradicts the principle of social justice - both in the distribution of resources and in the fair and just distribution of the tax burden.
      Hadash works to ensure an economic policy that prevents the rise in the cost of living and fully compensates workers and the entire public for any such price increases.
      2. Ending the privatization of the public sector with an emphasis on sensitive social aspects: education, health, and welfare.
      3. Ensuring equal job opportunities for all sectors and establishing industrial and employment zones in all regions of the country. Ending all forms of discrimination in the labor market based on nationality and gender.

      5. Permanent increase of the minimum wage based on linking it to the rise in the cost of living, with an emphasis on the increase that most affects the poor and weak strata, and relative to the general official wage rate.
      6. Increasing welfare allowances relative to the rise in the cost of living, mainly unemployment and income support allowances, increasing old-age allowances - especially for those who do not receive a pension, and increasing child allowances.
      7. Permanent increase based on clear principles of allowances for people with special needs, linked to the cost of living and their living needs.
      8. Expanding the Public Health Law - both in terms of the basket of health services and the basket of medicines. Stopping the phenomenon of supplementary health insurance, which creates medicine for the poor and medicine for the rich.
      9. Hadash works to strengthen trade unions with the aim of protecting workers, a strengthening that includes all trade unions while striving for the General Organization of Workers (Histadrut) to be the address for workers in defending their rights in all sectors, including the private sector.
      10. Abolishing poverty-stricken neighborhoods, building residential buildings at the state's expense, and transferring them to the residents of these neighborhoods based on the principle of "home for a home." This while ensuring housing at a monthly rent adapted to young couples and families with many children.
