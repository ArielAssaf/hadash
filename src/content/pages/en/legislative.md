        By law, employers who take security guarantees, checks, bills, or deposits from their employees will be subject to imprisonment and fines. The law also applies to contractor workers.

        ## Empowering the Labor Court to extend deadlines
        The purpose of the law is to allow the Labor Court to extend deadlines for filing lawsuits against the National Insurance Institute and appeals on its decisions. Until now, the law did not allow the court to extend these deadlines, even if the reasons were justified.

        ## Labor Law Enforcement Law
        Changing the law to include real mechanisms for protecting contractor workers. Currently only in cleaning, security, and catering sectors. An evolution of the bill "Client Responsibility for Contractor Workers' Rights" – which established that responsibility for maintaining the rights of contractor workers rests not only on the contractor employing them but also on the client ordering the services. The bill was prepared for second and third readings in the previous Knesset and led to the government bill that was finally accepted.

        ## Sick Pay Law (Absence due to child's illness)
        Grants parents of children with disabilities the right to additional vacation days and absence hours to assist their children. Promoted together with MK Uri Maklev.

This law aims to correct a situation where the worker was not told what conditions were agreed upon between the contractor and the actual employer, and ensure that upon commencement of employment, the worker is given the employment terms to which the contractor is committed vis-à-vis the actual employer. The law requires that the worker be given the necessary information to ensure the realization of their rights. Together with MK Haim Oron.

        ## Tenders Law Amendment (Prohibition of age discrimination)
        The law aims to prevent a situation where a person is discriminated against in tender proceedings due to their age.

        Accompaniment allowances, enabling blind people to pay for help required for basic mobility (e.g., shopping at the supermarket) and social integration, will now be protected from all types of garnishment. Since a significant portion of the blind population in Israel lives below the poverty line, many suffer from garnishments on their accounts due to debts.

        ## Abolition of imprisonment for debtors in Execution Office
        This law abolishes imprisonment as a means of collecting debts in the Execution Office (Hotzaa LaPoal), except for imprisonment for alimony debt. Alongside this, the law increases the collection means available to the creditor. Promoted with a group of MKs led by MK Merav Michaeli.

        This law considers not only the medical fitness of the firearm license applicant but also their mental fitness, and conditions the renewal of a firearm license on a psychologist's confirmation of the applicant's mental fitness.

Promoted together with a group of MKs led by MK David Tzur.

        ## The Law for Establishing a Fund from Gas Profits for Social Goals
        The complementary side to the stubborn struggle we led for the public's share of gas revenues and natural resources in general. This law ensures that gas revenues will not be swallowed into the general hole of the state budget but will be truly invested in social goals.

        ## Eligibility for compensation for Holocaust survivors who immigrated to Israel after 1953
        The law corrects the injustice caused to date to Holocaust survivors, canceling the discrimination regarding those who immigrated after 1953.

        ## Right to presence of a companion during medical treatment

        The second part of the law established that a summary of the approved budget of local committees shall be published both in the official gazette and on websites.

        ## Prevention of Criminal Record for Military Offenses Law

        ## Reducing the obligation to wear a helmet when riding bicycles
        The law significantly scales back the law from the 17th Knesset, which established that riding a bicycle without a helmet is a criminal offense. According to the law, the obligation will be limited only to extreme and sports riding outside the city and for children and youth.

        ## Income support benefit for women in shelters for battered women

This bill joins another bill of mine and MK Galon which passed second and third readings, allowing a woman in a shelter for battered women to receive income support.

        ## Reserving places for women in lists for local authorities

        The Fund for Children and Youth at Risk was originally established as a means to deal with the expansion of poverty, distress, and social problems among children and youth with the large cut in child allowances. Over the years, the Fund has developed a variety of assistance activities for at-risk children and youth, and its activity is praised from all sides. The Fund was initially established under a temporary order only planned to expire at the end of 2007. The law extended the Fund's activity by a year.

        ## Information Delivery to Parent Law
        Anchors the right of two parents living separately to receive information regarding their children.

        ## Youth Law Amendment (Trial, Punishment, and Modes of Treatment) – (Alternative Proceedings)
        Instead of sending teenagers to prison and training future criminals – the law creates a system of alternative proceedings, in which they take responsibility for their actions and are involved in corrective actions in various circles.

        ## The Polluter Pays Law
        A cross-cutting law updating and correcting all environmental laws in Israel. The law includes advanced mechanisms of economic punishment – administrative and criminal – against polluters. The law stiffens punishment for entities polluting without a license and establishes a collection mechanism also from entities polluting in accordance with the law. This mechanism is supposed to incentivize factories to switch to cleaner technologies.

        ## National Mine Action Authority Law
        The law establishes an authority to act for the clearance and removal of hundreds of minefields scattered across the country.

        ## Environmental Transparency Law – Duty to report on pollutant emissions
        A law requiring transparency regarding emissions of pollutants into the environment, imposing detailed reporting duties on factories, establishing a registry of emitted pollutants, and requiring publication of data for public knowledge. Experience teaches that environmental reporting duties change the behavior of polluting factories. Environmental transparency is a democratic tool and a central instrument for mobilizing the public to act against pollution and polluters. Evasion of reporting will be a criminal offense and will also entail significant administrative financial sanctions.

        ## Energy Efficiency in Public Buildings Law
        Establishes a comprehensive mechanism for reducing energy usage in the public system.

        The law creates a clear arrangement in the division of powers between the government and local government and ends the difficult situation where each of the two sides could paralyze the other's initiatives. The amendment requires the local authority to act to reduce air pollution from transportation in any situation where there is a high level of air pollution.

        ## Electronic Waste Recycling Law
        Electronic waste can cause soil and groundwater pollution. At the center of the law is the important social principle of "polluter pays".

        The declawing prohibited by the law is usually performed due to the desire of cat owners to protect home furniture. It is an irreversible surgery causing great pain to the animal.

        ## Dog Neutering/Spaying Law
        The purpose of the law is to deal humanely with the phenomenon of thousands of stray dogs euthanized annually in agony or experiencing severe abuse. According to the law, anyone who has their dog neutered or spayed will recoup the investment within two years thanks to the discount they will receive on the license fee.

        ## Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Law Amendment (New tools for law enforcement)
        The new law allows government inspectors to enter any place (except a residence) to perform inspections and verify that the provisions of the law are being met. The law adds authority to demand documents, take measurements, take samples, and more. Supervision and enforcement powers formulated two decades ago have been replaced by modern provisions suitable for the twenty-first century. Improvements were also made to the provision allowing animal protection organizations to request injunctions against abuse.
