<h2>Empowering the Labor Court to extend deadlines</h2>

<h2>Labor Law Enforcement Law</h2>
<p>Changing the law to include real mechanisms for protecting contractor workers. Currently only in cleaning, security, and catering sectors. An evolution of the bill &quot;Client Responsibility for Contractor Workers&#39; Rights&quot; – which established that responsibility for maintaining the rights of contractor workers rests not only on the contractor employing them but also on the client ordering the services.

<p>Grants parents of children with disabilities the right to additional vacation days and absence hours to assist their children. Promoted together with MK Uri Maklev.</p>
<h2>Notification to Employee Law</h2>

This law aims to correct a situation where the worker was not told what conditions were agreed upon between the contractor and the actual employer, and ensure that upon commencement of employment, the worker is given the employment terms to which the contractor is committed vis-à-vis the actual employer. The law requires that the worker be given the necessary information to ensure the realization of their rights. Together with MK Haim Oron.</p>
<h2>Tenders Law Amendment (Prohibition of age discrimination)</h2>
<p>The law aims to prevent a situation where a person is discriminated against in tender proceedings due to their age. Usually, this refers to discrimination against the older population, which is in a &quot;risk group&quot; for unequal and discriminatory treatment due to relatively advanced age compared to younger competitors in the tender.</p>
<h2>Paid Sabbatical on Local Election Day</h2>

<h2>Promotion of Competition in the Food Industry Law</h2>
<p>Among other things, by preventing geographic concentration and increasing regional competition, and by imposing a duty on large retailers to publish online the prices of products sold in each of their stores, enabling current ongoing comparison of basket prices.

<p>Instead of sending teenagers to prison and training future criminals – the law creates a system of alternative proceedings, in which they take responsibility for their actions and are involved in corrective actions in various circles. Global experience teaches that this is fairer and also more effective.</p>

<p>This is a law approved for first reading in the 16th Knesset and re-formulated in the 17th Knesset with the active involvement of MK Khenin. This is a comprehensive law regulating, for the first time in Israel, the issue of pollutant emissions into the air comprehensively, while tightening the ring around polluting industry.</p>
<h2>Prohibition of Driving on Beaches Law</h2>
<p>The law sets clear prohibitions and definitions for driving on beaches, sharpens punishment, and creates effective and modern enforcement mechanisms for the prohibition of driving on beaches.</p>
<h2>Environmental Enforcement Law</h2>
<p>Grants inspectors of the Ministry of Environmental Protection broad search and investigation powers. For the first time, subordinates various security systems to civil enforcement.</p>
<h2>Environmental Enforcement Law (Local Authorities)</h2>
<p>The proposal grants local authorities enforcement powers for environmental laws, thereby achieving simultaneously an important environmental goal (increasing enforcement of environmental laws) and an important social goal (flowing fine money from environmental polluters directly to the coffers of the authorities whose residents are the main victims of the pollution).</p>
<h2>Protection of the Kinneret Law</h2>
<p>A law applying the provisions of the Protection of the Coastal Environment Law to the shores of the Kinneret as well, and establishing an authority (Kinneret Cities Association) that will act to protect the Kinneret and its shores.</p>
<h2>Protection of Eilat Gulf Coastal Environment Law</h2>
<p>The law applies for the first time the Protection of the Coastal Environment Law, applicable to the Mediterranean shores, also to the Gulf of Eilat.</p>
<h2>The Polluter Pays Law</h2>
<p>A cross-cutting law updating and correcting all environmental laws in Israel. The law includes advanced mechanisms of economic punishment – administrative and criminal – against polluters. The law stiffens punishment for entities polluting without a license and establishes a collection mechanism also from entities polluting in accordance with the law. This mechanism is supposed to incentivize factories to switch to cleaner technologies.</p>
<h2>The New Deposit Law</h2>
<p>The law imposes direct responsibility on manufacturers based on the &quot;polluter pays&quot; principle.</p>
<h2>National Mine Action Authority Law</h2>
<p>The law establishes an authority to act for the clearance and removal of hundreds of minefields scattered across the country.</p>
<h2>Environmental Transparency Law – Duty to report on pollutant emissions</h2>
<p>A law requiring transparency regarding emissions of pollutants into the environment, imposing detailed reporting duties on factories, establishing a registry of emitted pollutants, and requiring publication of data for public knowledge. Experience teaches that environmental reporting duties change the behavior of polluting factories. Environmental transparency is a democratic tool and a central instrument for mobilizing the public to act against pollution and polluters. Evasion of reporting will be a criminal offense and will also entail significant administrative financial sanctions.</p>
<h2>Energy Efficiency in Public Buildings Law</h2>
<p>Establishes a comprehensive mechanism for reducing energy usage in the public system. Among other things, every public institution is committed to a defined plan for reducing energy consumption. It also includes a series of measures for energy saving including installation of energy-saving bulbs, replacement of electrical equipment, and procedure for its economical operation.</p>
<h2>Mandatory Installation of Water Saving Devices in Public Buildings Law</h2>
<p>Requires installation of water-saving devices, including flow restrictors, in all public buildings to save water.</p>
<h2>Law for Reducing Air Pollution from Transportation (Amendment 84 to Traffic Ordinance)</h2>
<p>The law creates a clear arrangement in the division of powers between the government and local government and ends the difficult situation where each of the two sides could paralyze the other&#39;s initiatives. The amendment requires the local authority to act to reduce air pollution from transportation in any situation where there is a high level of air pollution.</p>
<h2>Electronic Waste Recycling Law</h2>
<p>Electronic waste can cause soil and groundwater pollution. At the center of the law is the important social principle of &quot;polluter pays&quot;. The law expands the principle of producer responsibility for treating such waste and reducing it, and establishes a mechanism for regulating the collection and recycling of purchased devices.</p>
<h2>Arnona Exemption for Field Schools Law</h2>
<p>The law assists environmental educational institutions.</p>

<p>The law prohibits the import into Israel of cosmetics and cleaning products, not for health purposes, whose production process involved animal testing.</p>
<h2>Prohibition on Declawing Cats Not for Medical Purposes Law</h2>
<p>The declawing prohibited by the law is usually performed due to the desire of cat owners to protect home furniture. It is an irreversible surgery causing great pain to the animal.</p>
<h2>Dog Neutering/Spaying Law</h2>
<p>The purpose of the law is to deal humanely with the phenomenon of thousands of stray dogs euthanized annually in agony or experiencing severe abuse. According to the law, anyone who has their dog neutered or spayed will recoup the investment within two years thanks to the discount they will receive on the license fee.</p>
<h2>Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Law Amendment (New tools for law enforcement)</h2>
<p>The new law allows government inspectors to enter any place (except a residence) to perform inspections and verify that the provisions of the law are being met. The law adds authority to demand documents, take measurements, take samples, and more. Supervision and enforcement powers formulated two decades ago have been replaced by modern provisions suitable for the twenty-first century. Improvements were also made to the provision allowing animal protection organizations to request injunctions against abuse. &quot;Let the Animals Live&quot; accompanied the bill, and it was promoted together with MK Eitan Cabel.</p>
